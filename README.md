# Senior Sendoff
Author: Jade Chan, Date: Nov 2016

### SUMMARY
This website was intended as a fun, interactive quiz to bid farewell to the 
graduating seniors in PAC (Pan-Asian Council) at Tufts University in 2016. 

As this project was intended for one-time usage, it was written very quickly 
(not honestly not very well), and was in no way designed to be responsive.
